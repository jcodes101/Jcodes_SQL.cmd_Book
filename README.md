-- 19. JOINS (INNER JOIN)

INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;

-- Use when data is normalized across multiple tables.


-- 20. LEFT JOIN / RIGHT JOIN / FULL OUTER JOIN

-- Use when querying large tables on specific columns often.


-- 22. CREATE VIEW
-- A virtual table based on a SELECT query.
CREATE VIEW sales_employees AS
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';

-- 24. CASE (Conditional Logic)
SELECT first_name,
       salary,

FROM employees;

-- Use when you need IF/THEN logic in SQL.


-- 25. TRANSACTIONS
-- Ensures multiple SQL statements execute safely together.
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
